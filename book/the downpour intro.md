Greetings
---------

I am the author of this book, and I am glad you found your way here:

My life has not been easy, not to live nor to understand, sometimes I just wish I was like most, if not all of you readers: unaware of all the secrets of our ever changing world, everything…everyone, it’s just not right…it’s just…nevermind…Let me focus on what matters more, time is precious and I am running out of it, we all are.

And this is exactly why I am here, turning my thoughts and knowledge into words, sharing it with the world, at the cost of much, including my safety and the safety of others like me –

**“Humans needs to remain blind to the truth”**

This is the number one rule of our world, and I am about to break it –

My name does not matter right now, most of us abandon our birth names to adopt new ones once we reach the age where our stronger genes take over and reveals what we truly are, so for now I will be just “Jack”, and Jack is about to tell you everything you don’t know about – your life - not mine -

Every day you all get out of your beds to your boring jobs and lives, learning what you are told to, believing, living, loving, hatting…nothing is actually real...or better: nothing is actually true; it’s just made to look like it is so…, yes, you think yourself free but you’re only free from the truth, everything else in your so called life has nothing to do with freedom, yes your life, I know it’s sad, heavy, even offensive but the truth, if truth is to be told is that you all exist to sustain a lie, to spin the wheels of a society where everything and everyone above you in this crazy pyramid deceives you, lie to keep you blind, lie to keep you satisfied, they lie to keep you “ok” with this never ending routine, without questioning, without evolving and above all without changing a thing...Damn my head hurts, it was a long day and hide from you all while I fight a war right bellow your noses is not for the faint of heart…sometimes I wonder who would tear me apart first if I come out to the open: you Humans or any of the others…yeah, first truth about your life you’re about to learn: Humans share the world with other three very distinct Human like species, two of those hostile to your kind (and bad news again, these are the ones in control of your governments and social structures, the ones that keeps the leash on you all, all the time) the third one, well, they are actually friendly to you Humans, some even forging alliances with the very few of you that knows of their existence , in fact your kind escaped being eradicated more than once thanks to them…

I know I know, you must be confuse, thrice confuse I guess, but you read it alright, I guess putting it all together you might have figured out by now that I do not share blood with those that decided to be friendly to your kind , so again, yes…My kind is hostile to you, to you humans, as I personally was for a long time, now I am older and wiser, by the way I completed 26 last week, I miss birthday parties (my last one I was 15), anyway, I am wiser now, my genes turned when I was 16, so I can say a decade in my life is worth more than a generation in human wisdom, and by placing together a fragment of this knowledge I believe to have come to the truth on how to turn the tides in favor of my species, and at the same time benefit you all somehow…not in this society, this one is about to end, giving place to the beginning of a new age of survival of the fittest, in fact the cataclysm that is upon us all can (and will) turn the biggest of your cities into wastelands…

I cannot miss the joke, so here it goes: It’s funny how you Humans managed to romanticize this post apocalyptical life, to be fair you guys depict things very well in your movies and T.V shows, and yeah…pretty close to that; only do not count on zombies, your predators will be far from slow paced rotten bodies, they will be fast, cunning, strong and extremely powerful…and the most dangerous fact about them: They will be just as desperate for survival as all of you -

I made some good friends along the way, Humans among them, and together we decided to put up this website, be your “whistleblowers”, I was chosen to tell you all about our lives, how it all started, and how all of this applies, practically speaking…and finally how we believe it all will end, I will try to organize the information posted here as best as I can, my time is short but I will try to be as clear as possible, if I get absent for a few days I want you all to keep in mind that I live in a world where survive is a daily quest, and sit in front of a computer is a commodity, not an habit…

***But I will always be back, be patient.***

I will be honest and direct: I need you all to get ready for what it is to come, and the truth is that there is no return from the point we reached: Soon our world will be a post-apocalyptic landscape, as the gears that will shatter society is already spinning in a too fast pace to be stopped, my efforts here are not to try to prevent the disaster, but to prepare you all for it, trust me is not a choice, as in fact I am your only hope of learning anything in time.

This is from now on the book of your lives, your survival guide and your best shot of making through the reality that is about to rain down in your world like no storm you ever seen…welcome to The Downpour folks…the clouds are already gathered.

__Jack’s Note:__
_I have a friend, someone that has been suffering for almost as long as I am, and one of the few that accepted share the risk of letting all you guys know about the many things we have to say, there is a lot to explain and of course I do not feel like do it alone, to be honest my time and current pace of life does not allow me to do it alone, anyways…soon this friend of mine will be adding notes and answering questions around here, her name is Megan, and I wish you good luck folks, she is not the sweetest of things – cheers_
