**Chapter I - Megan White**

Boston – Massachusetts 4 months ago…

\- *It’s four in the morning for F%\#$ sake! Turn off this damn thing you b\*\#@%*! - shouted an unknown male voice while banging the other end of the wall – an unlucky request, Megan hardly cared about anything of this kind in the worse of her days, she would definitely not care about it in one of the best of her mornings, and so she continued to stare at the mirror while blowing her newly colored hair dry, with such vitreous expression that it could be taken by a mannequin if not for her eyes, uncommonly lit against her weak night lamp

\- *I am warning you w\#\*&! Turn this damn thing off! –* continued the man accompanied by even louder bangs against his side of the wall, Meg got startled this time, not by the shouts of the drunken neighbor, but by the headlights of a passing car that suddenly flooded her small first floor apartment, now fully revealing her face against the mirror and exposing the cracks in her apparently unblemished expression.

When under Threat the *Second born* - a variation of Human species that does not rely solely on carbon, but possessing as well the four valence electron binding inherited from the Human side, this, combined with their own genetic traits, gives the *Second Born* the ability to synthesize potent chemicals within their own bodies by absorbing and combining environmental particles, generating body and brain enhancing compounds and releasing it into their metabolism, increasing speed, strength, endurance, tissue regeneration, vision, hearing and others, turning their bodies into survival shelters or killing machines in a matter of minutes… But at the cost of dire physical damage once the effect of these chemicals wears off, this damage manifests itself in the form of deep cracks in their skin, these bruises gets increasingly hard to hide according to the severity of its nature, even harder once from within the very cracks a faint glow of blue or violet can be seen, result of leftovers of previous chemical reactions taking place bellow their skin, These bruises curable only by time and deep sleep and extremely sensitive to heat and light, makes the second born a mostly nocturne species – both beautiful and scary, the second born are the most vulnerable of the three, and also the youngest between the Non-purely Humans.

The name *Second Born* comes from street slangs originated in Hispanic communities, The turning of genes generally (but not only) happens after a apparently ordinary Human suffers a near death experience, the body triggers a last resort mechanism to stay alive forcing the mutation to happen, the doctors that witnessed these changes (mostly from e Hispanic origins) meant that their patients were “born a second time” and out of poor knowledge in English or simple language barrier, the expression and later nomination *second born* emerged, now being widely used in all hidden societies to refer to these Human like beings.

\- *I can’t believe it is finally today* – whispered Meg to her own reflection while she retouched the makeup over her damaged skin – *Ok, let’s see…passport, plane tickets, money…* - she stopped a second to look at a photography of a young man scrambled with the contents of her purse amid a huge mess of all kind of makeup – *See you soon Jack… I hope you are right about all this… anyway, leave this hole already makes this day an awesome day* – her thoughts were gently interrupted by a very soft noise coming from her window – *I guess it’s time for us both to fly* – Said Meg to a little bird that insistently tried to come out through the closed window - *Go on , be free, you are locked here with me for far too long…* - and as she opened the window the bird rapidly found its way to freedom, disappearing into the first lights of the morning – that calm moment was too good to last as Meg came to find out, Before she could enjoy any sort of peace or sense of freedom she was brought back to reality by loud bangs coming from the front door – *It’s time to teach this guy a lesson, will be my parting gift to my other lovely neighbors* – Said the skinny pale girl, now with a recently dyed red short hair that much contributed to her already deadly appearance as she dashed across the apartment.
