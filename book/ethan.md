Behind the door; a tall figure of a man in motorcycle clothes and helmet on made Meg breath in rapidly in surprise, igniting the glow on her makeup repaired skin - lying at his feet, the body of her overweight neighbor, motionless… dead – the tall man slowly removed his helmet revealing his face, a face Megan knew well and for long years as well as many troubles:

\- *Ethan… What have you done…* - Said Meg looking at the dead body, stumbling back inside the apartment, accidentally spreading the contents of her makeup purse, a nail polish flask slowly rolled to stop close to the hands of the dead man, leaking its viscous red content, only adding more drama to the scene

\- *Hello Meg, where are we going this morning?* – Said Ethan in an almost threatening tone, letting visible his hand dripping with fresh blood, human blood.
